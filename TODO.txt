[NOW]
- Cleanup out-of-screen GOs


[SOON]

> Powerup system
  - Add mega bomb
  - Add multi-shot
  - Limit level of each thing, after that just get points

- Add shooting enemies

> Add difficulty increase
  - Waves spawn more often
  - Enemies become tougher
  - New waves are added every now and then


> Create Human scene
  - ?? needs thinking.
    · Simple possibility: just time (self-destroy count-down), you run around and collect boxes, for a short time
    · More complex: alien infestation, requires some skill (but that's 2 games in one). MAYBE START WITH COUNT-DOWN (EASY TO IMPLEMENT), AND ONLY RETHINK IF THERE'S TIME (PROBABLY NOT ANYWAY  )

> Check TODO

> Create final tiles

> Add Menu Scene




[MAYBE]

- Show on screen what the power up did (or at least when it gives you money instead, or maybe have the icons in the UI, with the different levels indicated)
- Check FUTURE
- Before hitting the vcamGhost, add a vcamTransition that's on a track
- Add a better transition: some text on screen
