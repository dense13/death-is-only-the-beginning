[NOW]
- Add 2nd enemy


[SOON]

> Ghost phase
  - Implement waves
  - Enemy movement/non overlaping!

> Powerup system
  - Create different boxes
  - Create correspnding powerups: single shot, double shot


> Create Human scene
  - ?? needs thinking.
    · Simple possibility: just time (self-destroy count-down), you run around and collect boxes, for a short time
    · More complex: alien infestation, requires some skill (but that's 2 games in one). MAYBE START WITH COUNT-DOWN (EASY TO IMPLEMENT), AND ONLY RETHINK IF THERE'S TIME (PROBABLY NOT ANYWAY  )

> Check TODO

> Create final tiles

> Add Menu Scene




[MAYBE]

- Check FUTURE
- Before hitting the vcamGhost, add a vcamTransition that's on a track
- Add a better transition: some text on screen
